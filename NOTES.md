PHASE 1:
- Basic layout (no antd, since that's kinda ridiculous. I can make my own components)
- Remove extraneous includes and dependencies (maybe separate from umi? We'll see. I do really like dva)
- Investigate using more of React's effects functionality, maybe their context library
- Initiative Tracking
  - Add initiative row, given name and initiative roll total
  - Show current active turn (highlight row)
  - Auto sort by score
